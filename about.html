    <p>I am a third-year undergraduate student at the University of Maryland, College Park, and Iâ€™m pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Journalism. I have a passion for sports broadcasting, but I've honed my journalism skills in a variety of ways during my time at the UMD, such as writing, editing, and producing stories across different mediums.</p>
