          <p id="p-about">I first fell in love with broadcasting in 7th grade when my school received a grant to build a TV studio in its basement. My love hasn’t wavered since. I used to wear a suit and tie alongside my middle school classmates. Now, I wear a suit and tie alongside some of my closest friends at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism. My biggest aspiration is to spend most of my life working in sports television. As I try to launch my career, I don’t expect my passion to deviate. That’s why I put so much time into campus media and internship experiences.</p>
          <p id="p-about">I joined the staff of The Left Bench, a multimedia sports outlet, before I even attended a class at the University of Maryland. I was eager then, and I still am. As a part of this organization, I have learned invaluable knowledge that will help me be a successful broadcaster. I’ve gained the necessary skills to shoot, write, and edit sports packages on deadline, and the time spent in studio has showed me exactly how a video cast is presented. I’ve also learned how to be an effective reporter in many ways. Finding new angles and learning social media literacy are just a few traits that I can attribute to my experience.</p>
          <p id="p-about">I’ve also been eager to gain experience through various internships. My first opportunity to work as an intern was in high school at WCIU-TV in Chicago, where I reported on-camera at high school football games. In my second semester of college, I had a chance to work for a national media outlet: Sirius-XM College Sports. At Sirius-XM, I learned the ins and outs of sports talk radio by working with producers and on-air personalities.</p>
          <p id="p-about">Besides broadcasting, sports my other true love. I played baseball and basketball throughout high school, which I miss dearly. That’s why I love being on the sideline or in the booth — because talking about sports is often just as fun as playing.</p>
